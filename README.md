## 🎇 Apprenticeship:

In this project, I went through the entire Kotlin language base. I learned the fundamentals of OOP such as inheritance, interfaces, interface delegation, etc., as well as the fundamentals of functional programming such as pure functions, lambda functions, etc. In addition, I covered conditional structures, exception handling, types, logical operators, and much more.
